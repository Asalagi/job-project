                <p>Are you ready for a fun adventure today? There are a few things I 
                should mention before you start. Sometimes there are forks in the road
                make sure you remember which way you are going so you don't get lost. 
                Make sure you stay aware of your surrounds and watch out for bears, 
                cougars and snakes. There have been some rumors about treasures and 
                valuable items have been found.</p>
